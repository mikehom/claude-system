# Pre-compaction context preservation.
# PreCompact hook
#
# Two outputs:
#   1. Persistent file: .claude/.preserved-context (survives compaction, read by session-init.sh)
#   2. additionalContext: injected into the system message before compaction
#
# The additionalContext includes a directive instructing Claude to generate
# a structured context summary (per context-preservation skill) as part of
# the compaction. This ensures session intent (not just project state) survives.
