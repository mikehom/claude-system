# Orchestrator dispatch advisory for Write/Edit operations.
# PreToolUse hook — matcher: Write|Edit
#
# DECISION: Advisory-only orchestrator bypass detection. Rationale: CLAUDE.md
# Dispatch Rules say the orchestrator must not write source code directly, but
# no hook enforced this. A hard deny isn't possible (can't reliably detect
# orchestrator vs subagent), so this emits additionalContext as a visible
# reminder. Combined with branch-guard + plan-check + doc-gate, this
# significantly raises the bar for accidental orchestrator writes. Status: accepted.
#
# Emits additionalContext (advisory, not deny) when a source file write appears
# to come from the orchestrator session. Uses the same exemptions as other
# hooks (.claude/, config, docs, tests, MASTER_PLAN.md).
