# SubagentStop:implementer — deterministic validation of implementer output.
# Replaces AI agent hook. Checks worktree usage and @decision annotation coverage.
# Exits 2 (feedback loop) when proof-of-work is missing — forces implementer resume.
# Exits 0 when proof-of-work is verified or when loop guard triggers escalation.
#
# DECISION: Blocking proof-of-work enforcement. Rationale: Advisory-only hook
# (exit 0 always) was routinely skipped — agents declared "done" without live demo.
# Exit 2 forces the orchestrator to resume the implementer, creating an unavoidable
# feedback loop. Loop guard (2+ resumes) escalates to user to prevent infinite loops.
# Status: accepted.
