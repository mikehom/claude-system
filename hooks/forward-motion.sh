# Forward motion check for assistant responses.
# Stop hook — runs when Claude finishes responding.
#
# DECISION: Replace AI agent with deterministic regex. Rationale: The forward
# motion check is a simple pattern match (?, "want me to", "shall I", etc.)
# that doesn't require semantic understanding. Shell regex saves 10s + tokens
# per session end with identical accuracy. Status: accepted.
#
# Checks the last paragraph of the assistant's response for forward motion
# indicators: questions, offers, suggestions. Returns exit 2 (feedback) only
# if the response ends with a bare completion statement and no forward motion.
